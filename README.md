<image src="teditor.gif">

A simple text and code editor made in ncurses with UTF-8 support, mouse events (including scroll and clicks), autotab, a permanent stratch buffer (just run `ted`, without any argument) and help page(s). All this with only less than 1000 lines of C code (counting with cloc).
